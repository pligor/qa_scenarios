# Importance  

### Feature

prio_critical: If the scenario fails means that the user will be blocked of doing basic stuff and that QA recommends that this part of the app is not ready to be released  

prio_major: Scenarios which are both important for the normal flow of the user and at the same time are more likely to have defects  
prio_minor: everything else not belonging to below or above categories  

prio_trivial: Scenarios which even if they have a defect, the user is still able to overcome this issue and proceed with his/her task  

Put priorities thinking of the Feature and NOT the Product  
Example:  
Adding/Deleting Notes are crucial actions of the Notes Feature but the entire Notes Feature might be minor for the product in general since

### Product

To tag an entire feature of which priority this has in relation to the product use correspondingly the:

product_critical: This feature is critical for the users of the Product and any malfunction of it, will have a huge negative impact on the product

product_major: The feature is not being used by all users of the system but a significant portion of them is frequently using it, and therefore defects/bugs in this feature will have a large negative impact on the product

product_minor: The users can leave without this feature for some time as it does not prevent them from navigating through critical paths or using core features of the app

product_trivial: This feature is a purely nice to have and the few users who are using it could live without it for a quite substantial amount of time or this is a new feature that the business is not investing much on it
