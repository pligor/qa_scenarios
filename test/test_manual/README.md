### Bugs/Findings being generated by testing manually shall have 4 kinds of priorities:

- prio_critical: Blocker and the release should be blocked for any related functionality, where related functionality could be a specific feature or an entire app depending on the context


- prio_major: At some extent the app can survive temporarily with the current defect, but it is either hurting the acceptance criteria or it is a great pain for the customer and in general it is considered of high importance


- prio_minor: The app can survive for quite some time having this defect exposed to the customer but for reasons of identity, to provide an elegant app, for building trust with the users and in general offering a more than positive user experience this needs to be resolved at some point


- prio_trivial: Defects which can be neglected and the user can easily find a workaround to accomplish his/her goal. These defects should be resolved if we want a pixel perfect app and we want to offer a premium user experience to the end customer
